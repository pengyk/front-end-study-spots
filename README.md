# Study spots front end (WIP)

## Usage

Similar to rate my profs, but for school libraries :)

## Getting Started (next js)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Need backend to run also in order to have it running: you can find it under similar repo.
